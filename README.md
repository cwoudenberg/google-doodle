# Jungle Google Doodle
The idea for my Google Doodle is a jungle. I am an avid houseplant collector, so my home has a lot of rare tropical plants in it. I wanted to design/create a Doodle that would reflect a "National Plant Day" that would feature some plants in it. I am still working through some kinks, so I am missing the "jungle cat" that I want to include. This project has been a lot of fun so far, and I can't wait to keep building on it.
